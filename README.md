# Bootstrap-porfolio


## A template for personal porfolio

The purpose of this project is to build a responsive website containing various navigation, visual and interactive tools for easy access to information.
The content of the page is build so that it could be used as a template for future editing and adding information to personal portfolio. It uses various bootstrap elements which could be edited or utilised as needed. 

I have used css and html to build seperate sections. In addition to that I have used bootsrap elements and used some grid layouts and css tools to personalise the layout and content.
